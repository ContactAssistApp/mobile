    "q1": "What is the purpose of this app?",
    "a1": "CommonCircle Assist (formerly UW CovidSafe) is one of a pair of companion apps that seek to reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community, specifically by connecting you to the appropriate public health guidance for more peace of mind as the community reopens, and by enabling effective contact tracing. You can opt-in to recieve alerts from your local public health department and keep track of important information that may protect you and others if you become ill, such as symptoms, locations, and people you've recently come into contact with in the last 14 days. If you are asked to complete a contact tracing interview, CommonCircle Assist provides you with a safe, private, and fast way to communicate this information to the people who need it — public health authorities and their contact tracing teams.",
    "q2": "How does this app benefit me?",
    "a2": "CommonCircle Assist allows you to log important information that could protect yourself and others if you become ill or are confirmed positive, including symptoms, locations, and people you've recently come into contact with in the last 14 days. You can have this information readily available if you are exposed and called for a contact tracing interview. You can also get reliable, vetted information about SARS-CoV-2, why it's so dangerous, and how it spreads.",
    "q3": "Who can use CommonCircle Assist?",
    "a3": "CommonCircle Assist is free, and anyone can use it.",
    "q4": "Who else benefits from my participation with this app?",
    "a4": "If you test positive for coronavirus, or are asked to complete a contact tracing interview, CommonCircle Assist can help you securely organize and share information of your chosing with your interviewer. Specifically, in the event you may become ill, are exposed, or confirmed positive, location information can be used to better inform community messages sent by public health officials, while keeping your identity and personal information private.",
    "q5": "How does CommonCircle Assist help public health officials?",
    "a5": "Traditional contact tracing interviews done by public health services are important, laborious, complicated and can sometimes omit important contacts because patients forget to mention them. CommonCircle Assist helps people who have tested positive remember locations they\u2019ve visited recently, by providing an objective log, which they can then share with contact tracing teams. There is also functionality to organize the contact information of known contacts, which streamlines the interview process and enables contact tracers to work faster.",
    "pq6": "What data is stored on my phone?",
    "pa6": "Your privacy and data security is important to us. You control your data at all times. The only data stored on your phone is information you choose to log, whether it's automatically through GPS location logging or information you add to the app one-by-one. If you turn on location logging, you can easily turn if off from the home screen or Settings menu, while individual log entries such as specific locations, symptoms, or contacts may be edited, added or deleted at any time. You can also choose to delete your data completely from CommonCircle Assist from the Settings menu.",
    "pq8": "Will this information be shared with government agencies?",
    "pa8": "CommonCircle Assist won't alert government agencies about your identity or information stored on your phone. In order to help contain the spread of COVID19, you can elect to share that information during a contact tracing interview with a public health professional. However, this will be the decision of the user how they share this information and with whom.",
    "aq1": "What is contact tracing?",
    "aa1": "Contact tracing is a process that helps identify all the people who may have come into contact with a person who is ill. Traditionally, contact tracing is accomplished by public health workers interviewing the person who is ill to learn about people they've been in contact with and locations they've recently visited within a specific period of time, such as the past two weeks. If you are asked to complete a contact tracing interview, CommonCircle Assist can help you prepare important information in advance, which can then be referenced during your interview.",
    "aq2": "Why should I report my illness?",
    "aa2": "If you become ill, you can use the app to improve the efficiency and completeness of manual contact tracing interviews. Your privacy is maximized by ensuring that all the data remains on your device, except for what you voluntarily reveal to healthcare authorities to enable contact tracing.",
